# React UI Component Library Template - PRD

## Project Overview
A comprehensive, production-ready template for building modern React UI component libraries. This template provides all the necessary tooling, configuration, and structure to quickly bootstrap a new component library without worrying about setup complexity.

## Objectives
- **Rapid Development**: Enable developers to start building components immediately
- **Production Ready**: Include all modern tooling for quality, testing, and deployment
- **Developer Experience**: Provide excellent DX with TypeScript, Storybook, and automated workflows
- **Maintainability**: Enforce code quality through linting, formatting, and git hooks

## Core Features

### 1. TypeScript Support
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Type definitions for all components
- Export types for consumers

### 2. Build System
- Vite/Rollup for optimized bundling
- Multiple output formats (ESM, CJS)
- Tree-shaking support
- Source maps

### 3. Component Development
- Example Button component with multiple variants
- Consistent component architecture patterns
- Props interface definitions

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Jest test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Coverage reporting
- Test utilities and setup

### 5. Documentation & Development
- Storybook for component documentation
- Interactive component playground
- Auto-generated documentation

### 6. Code Quality
- ESLint with React/TypeScript rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Husky for git hooks
- Pre-commit linting and testing

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing on PRs
- Build verification
- Optional npm publishing
